Also Bank Statements are generated containing a subset of\nthe CODA information (only those transaction lines that are required for the\ncreation of the Financial Accounting records). The CODA Bank Statement is a\n'read-only' object, hence remaining a reliable representation of the original\nCODA file whereas the Bank Statement will get modified as required by accounting\nbusiness processes.\n\nCODA Bank Accounts configured as type 'Info' will only generate CODA Bank Statements.\n\nA removal of one object in the CODA processing results in the removal of the\nassociated objects. The removal of a CODA File containing multiple Bank\nStatements will also remove those associated statements.\n\nInstead of a manual adjustment of the generated Bank Statements, you can also\nre-import the CODA after updating the OpenERP database with the information that\nwas missing to allow automatic reconciliation.\n\nRemark on CODA V1 support:\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nIn some cases a transaction code, transaction category or structured\ncommunication code has been given a new or clearer description in CODA V2.The\ndescription provided by the CODA configuration tables is based upon the CODA\nV2.2 specifications.\nIf required, you can manually adjust the descriptions via the CODA configuration menu.\n	f	f	f	OEEL-1	100	t	f	\N	\N	\N	\N

The country is inferred from the\n2-letter country code that prefixes the VAT number, e.g. ``BE0477472701``\nwill be validated using the Belgian rules.\n\nThere are two different levels of VAT number validation:\n--------------------------------------------------------\n    * By default, a simple off-line check is performed using the known validation\n      rules for the country, usually a simple check digit. This is quick and \n      always available, but allows numbers that are perhaps not truly allocated,\n      or not valid anymore.\n\n    * When the "VAT VIES Check" option is enabled (in the configuration of the user's\n      Company), VAT numbers will be instead submitted to the online EU VIES\n      database, which will truly verify that the number is valid and currently\n      allocated to a EU company. This is a little bit slower than the simple\n      off-line check, requires an Internet connection, and may not be available\n      all the time. If the service is not available or does not support the\n      requested country (e.g. for non-EU countries), a simple check will be performed\n      instead.\n\nSupported countries currently include EU countries, and a few non-EU countries\nsuch as Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Norway or Russia. For unsupported countries,\nonly the country code will be validated.\n    	f	f	f	LGPL-3	100	f	f	\N	\N	\N	\N

An\n        option in the dashboard will then allow you to view all the payments generated\n        via SDD and to generate a XML collection file for them, grouping them as\n        you see fit.\n\n        A dedicated 'SEPA Direct Debit' payment method is also available for\n        open invoices, when selecting a bank account in the 'register payment' wizard.\n        Use it to generate a SDD payment for the invoices if you added a mandate\n        for its owner after its validation. You will see an error message if you\n        try to use this method on an invoice for whose payment no mandate can be used.\n    	f	f	f	OEEL-1	100	f	f	\N	\N	\N	\N

Las NIIF completas y la NIIF PYMES no\ncontienen prescripciones sobre teneduría de libros, y consecuentemente, sobre los libros y otros registros \nde naturaleza contable. Por otro lado, si bien es cierto la contabilidad es también un insumo, dentro de otros, para \nlabores de cumplimiento tributario, este PCGE no ha sido elaborado para satisfacer prescripciones tributarias ni su \nverificación. No obstante ello, donde no hubo oposición entre la contabilidad financiera prescrita por las NIIF y\nla legislación tributaria, este PCGE ha incluido subcuentas, divisionarias y sub divisionarias, para\ndistinguir componentes con validez tributaria, dentro del conjunto de componentes que corresponden a una\nperspectiva contable íntegramente. Por lo tanto, este PCGE no debe ser considerado en ningún aspecto\ncomo una guía con propósitos distintos del contable.	f	f	f	LGPL-3	100	f	f	\N	\N	\N	\N

In order to simplify the application of this EU\ndirective, the Mini One Stop Shop (MOSS) registration scheme\nallows businesses to make a unique tax declaration.\n\nThis module makes it possible by helping with the creation\nof the required EU fiscal positions and taxes in order to\nautomatically apply and record the required taxes.\n\nThis module installs a wizard to help setup fiscal positions\nand taxes for selling electronic services inside EU.\n\nThe wizard lets you select:\n - the EU countries to which you are selling these\n   services\n - your national VAT tax for services, to be mapped\n   to the target country's tax\n - optionally: a template fiscal position, in order\n   to copy the account mapping. Should be your\n   existing B2C Intra-EU fiscal position. (defaults\n   to no account mapping)\n - optionally: an account to use for collecting the\n   tax amounts (defaults to the account used by your\n   national VAT tax for services)\n\nIt creates the corresponding fiscal positions and taxes,\nautomatically applicable for EU sales with a customer\nin the selected countries.\nThe wizard can be run again for adding more countries.\n\nThe wizard creates a separate Chart of Taxes for collecting the\nVAT amounts of the MOSS declaration, so extracting the MOSS\ndata should be easy.\nLook for a Chart of Taxes named "EU MOSS VAT Chart" in the\nTaxes Report menu (Generic Accounting Report).\n\nReferences\n++++++++++\n- Directive 2008/8/EC\n- Council Implementing Regulation (EU) No 1042/2013\n\n    	f	f	f	LGPL-3	100	f	f	\N	\N	\N	\N

If your localization has this requirements then you need to depend on this module and define in your localization module the identifications types that are used in your country. Generally these types of identifications are defined by the government authorities that regulate the fiscal operations. For example:\n\n* AFIP in Argentina defines DNI, CUIT (vat for legal entities), CUIL (vat for natural person), and another 80 valid identification types.\n\nEach identification holds this information:\n\n* name: short name of the identification\n* description: could be the same short name or a long name\n* country_id: the country where this identification belongs\n* is_vat: identify this record as the corresponding VAT for the specific country.\n* sequence: let us to sort the identification types depending on the ones that are most used.\n* active: we can activate/inactivate identifications to make it easier to our customers\n\nIn order to make this module compatible for multi-company environments where we have companies that does not need/support this requirement, we have added generic identification types and generic rules to manage the contact information and make it transparent for the user when only use the VAT as we formerly know.\n\nGeneric Identifications:\n\n* VAT: The Fiscal Tax Identification or VAT number, by default will be selected as identification type so the user will only need to add the related vat number.\n* Passport\n* Foreign ID (Foreign National Document)\n\nRules when creating a new partner: We will only see the identification types that are meaningful, taking into account these rules:\n\n* If the partner have not country address set: Will show the generic identification types plus the ones defined in the partner's related company country (If the partner has not specific company then will show the identification types related to the current user company)\n\n* If the partner has country address : will show the generic identification types plus the ones defined for the country of the partner.\n\nWhen creating a new company, will set to the related partner always the related country is_vat identification type.\n\nAll the defined identification types can be reviewed and activate/deactivate in "Contacts / Configuration / Identification Type" menu.\n\nThis module is compatible with base_vat module in order to be able to validate VAT numbers for each country that have or not have the possibility to manage multiple identification types.\n	f	f	f	LGPL-3	14	f	f	\N	\N	\N	\N

Start feeling good by checking tasks as done.\n\nAdapts to Your Creative Process\n-------------------------------\n\n### Customize to your own workflow\n\nEveryone has their own way to organize activities. Odoo Notes' smart kanban approach allows every user to customize their own steps to process it's to-dos and notes.\n\n### A Creative Person\n\nA creative person will organize notes based on idea's maturity level: Draft Ideas ** Mature Ideas ** Specified **To Do\n\n### A Frequent Traveler\n\nAn employee travelling a lot can organize their tasks based on the context to perform the task: U.S. Office | London's Office | To Review during Flights | At Home\n\n### A Manager\n\nA manager will organize their high number of tasks based on prioritizations: Todo Today | This Week | This Month | Later\n\nPersonnal Notes\n---------------\n\n### Notes are private but can be shared\n\nWrite down your ideas in pads, keep your notes at your finger tips, attach related documents and use tags and colors to organize the information. Once your ideas are mature, you can share them to others users, start discussing it and collaborate by improving the specification in the pad.\n\nCollaborative Meeting Minutes\n-----------------------------\n\n### Real-time sharing and edition of notes\n\nThe real time collaborative writings on notes makes it the perfect tool to collaborate on meeting minutes. Attendees will be able to contribute to the minutes, attach important documents or discuss on the related thread.\n\n	t	f	f	LGPL-3	45	f	f	\N	\N	\N	\N

It doesn't apply to\ncompanies based in the DOM-TOMs (Guadeloupe, Martinique, Guyane, Réunion, Mayotte).\n\nThis localisation module creates the VAT taxes of type 'tax included' for purchases\n(it is notably required when you use the module 'hr_expense'). Beware that these\n'tax included' VAT taxes are not managed by the fiscal positions provided by this\nmodule (because it is complex to manage both 'tax excluded' and 'tax included'\nscenarios in fiscal positions).\n\nThis localisation module doesn't properly handle the scenario when a France-mainland\ncompany sells services to a company based in the DOMs. We could manage it in the\nfiscal positions, but it would require to differentiate between 'product' VAT taxes\nand 'service' VAT taxes. We consider that it is too 'heavy' to have this by default\nin l10n_fr; companies that sell services to DOM-based companies should update the\nconfiguration of their taxes and fiscal positions manually.\n\n**Credits:** Sistheo, Zeekom, CrysaLEAD, Akretion and Camptocamp.\n	f	f	f	LGPL-3	100	f	f	\N	\N	\N	\N

However this customer comes to your location\nwith their truck to pick up products. On the customer, do not set any fiscal position.\n\n3) An international vendor doesn't charge you any tax. Taxes are charged at customs\nby the customs broker. On the vendor, set the fiscal position to International.\n\n4) An international vendor charge you your provincial tax. They are registered with your\nposition.\n    	f	f	f	LGPL-3	100	f	f	\N	\N	\N	\N

The chart of account creation wizard has been extended to \npropagate those new data properly.\n\nIt's important to note however that this module lack many implementations to \nuse Odoo properly in Brazil. Those implementations (such as the electronic \nfiscal Invoicing which is already operational) are brought by more than 15 \nadditional modules of the Brazilian Launchpad localization project \nhttps://launchpad.net/openerp.pt-br-localiz and their dependencies in the \nextra addons branch. Those modules aim at not breaking with the remarkable \nOdoo modularity, this is why they are numerous but small. One of the \nreasons for maintaining those modules apart is that Brazilian Localization \nleaders need commit rights agility to complete the localization as companies \nfund the remaining legal requirements (such as soon fiscal ledgers, \naccounting SPED, fiscal SPED and PAF ECF that are still missing as September \n2011). Those modules are also strictly licensed under AGPL V3 and today don't \ncome with any additional paid permission for online use of 'private modules'.\n	f	f	f	LGPL-3	100	f	f	\N	\N	\N	\N

Different companies may have different\nLDAP servers, as long as they have unique usernames (usernames need to be unique\nin Odoo, even across multiple companies).\n\nAnonymous LDAP binding is also supported (for LDAP servers that allow it), by\nsimply keeping the LDAP user and password empty in the LDAP configuration.\nThis does not allow anonymous authentication for users, it is only for the master\nLDAP account that is used to verify if a user exists before attempting to\nauthenticate it.\n\nSecuring the connection with STARTTLS is available for LDAP servers supporting\nit, by enabling the TLS option in the LDAP configuration.\n\nFor further options configuring the LDAP settings, refer to the ldap.conf\nmanpage: manpage:`ldap.conf(5)`.\n\nSecurity Considerations:\n------------------------\nUsers' LDAP passwords are never stored in the Odoo database, the LDAP server\nis queried whenever a user needs to be authenticated. No duplication of the\npassword occurs, and passwords are managed in one place only.\n\nOdoo does not manage password changes in the LDAP, so any change of password\nshould be conducted by other means in the LDAP directory directly (for LDAP users).\n\nIt is also possible to have local Odoo users in the database along with\nLDAP-authenticated users (the Administrator account is one obvious example).\n\nHere is how it works:\n---------------------\n    * The system first attempts to authenticate users against the local Odoo\n      database;\n    * if this authentication fails (for example because the user has no local\n      password), the system then attempts to authenticate against LDAP;\n\nAs LDAP users have blank passwords by default in the local Odoo database\n(which means no access), the first step always fails and the LDAP server is\nqueried to do the authentication.\n\nEnabling STARTTLS ensures that the authentication query to the LDAP server is\nencrypted.\n\nUser Template:\n--------------\nIn the LDAP configuration on the General Settings, it is possible to select a *User\nTemplate*. If set, this user will be used as template to create the local users\nwhenever someone authenticates for the first time via LDAP authentication. This\nallows pre-setting the default groups and menus of the first-time users.\n\n**Warning:** if you set a password for the user template, this password will be\n         assigned as local password for each new LDAP user, effectively setting\n         a *master password* for these users (until manually changed). You\n         usually do not want this. One easy way to setup a template user is to\n         login once with a valid LDAP user, let Odoo create a blank local\n         user with the same login (and a blank password), then rename this new\n         user to a username that does not exist in LDAP, and setup its groups\n	f	f	f	LGPL-3	100	f	f	\N	\N	\N	\N

Go to your company and configure your VAT number and AFIP Responsibility Type\n2. Go to Accounting / Settings and set the Chart of Account that you will like to use.\n3. Create your Sale journals taking into account AFIP POS info.\n\nDemo data for testing:\n\n* 3 companies were created, one for each AFIP responsibility type with the respective Chart of Account installed. Choose the company that fix you in order to make tests:\n\n  * (AR) Responsable Inscripto\n  * (AR) Exento\n  * (AR) Monotributo\n\n* Journal sales configured to Pre printed and Expo invoices in all companies\n* Invoices and other documents examples already validated in “(AR) Responsable Inscripto” company\n* Partners example for the different responsibility types:\n\n  * ADHOC (IVA Responsable Inscripto)\n  * Consejo Municipal Rosario (IVA Sujeto Exento)\n  * Gritti (Monotributo)\n  * Cerro Castor. IVA Liberado in Zona Franca\n  * Expresso (Cliente del Exterior)\n  * Odoo (Proveedor del Exterior)\n\nHighlights:\n\n* Chart of account will not be automatically installed, each CoA Template depends on the AFIP Responsibility of the company, you will need to install the CoA for your needs.\n* No sales journals will be generated when installing a CoA, you will need to configure your journals manually.\n* The Document type will be properly pre selected when creating an invoice depending on the fiscal responsibility of the issuer and receiver of the document and the related journal.\n* A CBU account type has been added and also CBU Validation\n\n\nTechnical\n---------\n\nThis module adds both models and fields that will be eventually used for the electronic invoice module. Here is a summary of the main features:\n\nMaster Data:\n\n* Chart of Account: one for each AFIP responsibility that is related to a legal entity:\n\n  * Responsable Inscripto (RI)\n  * Exento (EX)\n  * Monotributo (Mono)\n\n* Argentinian Taxes and Account Tax Groups (VAT taxes with the existing aliquots and other types)\n* AFIP Responsibility Types\n* Fiscal Positions (in order to map taxes)\n* Legal Documents Types in Argentina\n* Identification Types valid in Argentina.\n* Country AFIP codes and Country VAT codes for legal entities, natural persons and others\n* Currency AFIP codes\n* Unit of measures AFIP codes\n* Partners: Consumidor Final and AFIP\n	f	f	f	LGPL-3	100	f	f	\N	\N	\N	\N
